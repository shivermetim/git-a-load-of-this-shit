*******************************************************

This archive contains TECO-C modified and compiled for DOS, Win32,
OS/2, and Linux (on Intel 32bit architecture).  The modifications have been made by:

                Tom Almy
                tomalmy@aracnet.com

who is a "old time" TECO user. Not only did I port TECO-C but I also
corrected some bugs. For OS/2 modified the file backup algorithm to do
copying rather than renaming as an option. This makes it Workplace
Shell friendly. The Win32, Linux and OS/2 versions allow long file names.

Included files in this archive:

readme.1st      This file
readme.txt      Quick operating instructions for the TECO literate
readme.lnx      Operating and install instructions for Linux users
wchart.txt      List of all the implemented commands.
teco.doc        The official teco reference. TECOC IS CLOSE TO TECO-11 IN FUNCTIONALITY
*.tes           TECO command files for various things
*.tec           Compressed TECO command files

These apply to OS/2, DOS, and Windows versions:
inspect.cmd     Command files to invoke tecoc
inspect.bat     (cmd for OS/2, bat for DOS/Win32)
mung.cmd
mung.bat
teco.cmd
teco.bat
tmake.cmd       this would be "make" but most people use the program
                "make". 
tmake.bat
tecocmd.btm     Equivalent aliases for JPSoft products (4DOS, et cetera)



The executable program is downloaded as a separate file.
