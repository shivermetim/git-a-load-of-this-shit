Running TECOC on Linux

Tecoc takes a first argument of mung, teco, or make to control its
operating mode. In this Linux version, the name of the executable is
tested to provide this first argument. Typically soft links are used
to the tecoc executable, however aliases could be used instead. The
mapping is:

Make  is tecoc make  (note uppercase first letter)
teco  is tecoc teco
mung  is tecoc mung
inspect is tecoc teco -inspect

The provided TAR file has these four soft links defined. Extract the
TAR file into a directory in your path, typically /usr/local/bin,
after making sure none of the command names already exist for other
applications. Necessary environment variables and files are described below.

Several option switches are allowed on the TECO command line:

   -in[spect]  -- Read file only, don't create an output file.
   -noc[reate] -- If file doesn't exist, don't create it.
   -noi[ni]    -- Don't execute INI file. (valid for MAKE or MUNG as well)
   -nom[emory] -- don't save filename as "last edited file" (valid for
                  MAKE also)
   -nop[age]   -- Formfeeds don't stop file reads (valid for MAKE also)
   -nor[ename] -- Don't rename files, but copy them to keep references correct
                  (OS/2 only)
   +nnn	       -- sets NOPAGE and positions dot to line nnn.

The part of the switch name in the square brackets is optional. For
instance "-in" is the same as "-inspect".

MAKE filespec

   starts tecoc to create file filespec. Does equivalent of EWfilespec$$

TECO filespec

   starts tecoc to edit file filespec. Does equivalent of
   EBfilespec$Y$

TECO filespec2=filespec1

   starts tecoc to edit filespec1, writing to filespec2. Does
   equivalent of ERfilespec1$EWfilespec2$Y$$

TECO

   starts tecoc to edit last edited file. Filename is saved in file
   named teco*.tmp in the current directory, unless overriden
   (described below).

MUNG filespec <args>

   starts tecoc to execute filespec. Equivalent to
   I<args>$JEIfilespec$$ 

   You can use "TECO @filespec <args>" instead of MUNG.

**************
Key Bindings

The keys mentioned in the teco.doc file are somewhat confusing. 
This should help:

<DELIM>         The "Esc" key, "Esc" echoes as "$", however the 
                teco.doc file shows it as '`'.
<BS>            Type as Control-h, this isn't the "Backspace" key.
<DELETE>        The "Backspace" key. This isn't the "Delete" key.
<CR>            The "Enter" key.
<LF>            Type as Control-j.

Note that the assignments for <BS> and <DELETE> shown here are
swapped. <BS> can be "Backspace" and <DELETE> can be control-h by
clearing ET&2048, e.g. 2048,0ET


**************

The Initialization File.

Tecoc mungs (executes as teco commands) the file TECO.INI in the
current directory before processing the command line. Initialization
can be done instead by defining a TEC_INIT environment variable. The
value is either the list of teco commands to execute or a "$" followed
by the pathname of the file containing the initialization file. This
allows a single, centrally located initialization file. REMEMBER that
the "$" must be escaped, i.e. "\$"

The initialization file can be used to make initial settings. It can
return a value, but the value setting is somewhat obscure.

Example (csh):
setenv TEC_INIT 1es

Example (bash):
TEC_INIT=1es
export TEC_INIT

will cause successful searches to auto-display in all teco sessions.

**************

Changing the location of the memory file.

Define the environment variable TEC_MEMORY to be "$" followed by the
pathname of the file designated the memory file.

Example (csh):
setenv TEC_MEMORY ~/teco.mem
setenv TEC_MEMORY \$$TEC_MEMORY
Example (bash):
TEC_MEMORY = ~/teco.mem
TEC_MEMORY = \$$TEC_MEMORY
export TEC_MEMORY

will cause the name of the last edit file to be stored in the file
teco.mem in the home directory. By default the file name is tecoN.tmp in
the current directory, where "N" is the process ID of the parent process to
teco.


**************

The Libary directory

Defining the environment variable TEC_LIBRARY to be a directory path
(including the final "/") will allow the EI command to fetch
teco commands from this directory if the file is not found in the
current directory.

Example (csh):
setenv TEC_LIBRARY=\$/usr/local/lib/

will cause the directory /usr/local/lib to be searched for teco command files.


**************

Implemented flags:

ED&1	Allow carat "^" character in string searches
ED&2    Allow yank and _ unconditionally
ED&16   Failed searches preserve dot
ED&64   Move dot by one after each match in multiple occurance searches

ET&1    Type out in image mode
ET&2    Use scope for delete and control-U (default=1)
ET&4    Accept lowercase input (default=1)
ET&8    ^T reads without echo
ET&32   ^T reads with no wait
ET&128  MUNG mode (abort on error) cleared by "*" prompt
ET&2048 Swap backspace and delete
ET&4096 We are using 8 bit characters (default=1)
ET&32768 Trap control-C 

EZ&1 Mark Henderson,  who did much of the Unix port,  likes the way
	VAX/VMS	keeps versions of files.  VMS appends a semicolon followed
	by a version number to files,  and has the PURGE command to clean
	out old versions of files.  If this bit is off,  TECO-C will handle
	file version numbers,  appending the appropriate version number to
	file names.  Mark supplied a "purge" program (distributed with TECO-C)
	for users of this feature.  Setting this flag turns off the feature,
	to make TECO-C function as expected by the average Unix user.  This
	flag is set by default.
EZ&128  Don't stop read on formfeeds 
EZ&256	If set,  don't do newline translation on file read/write -- binary mode. 
        TECO is based on separate carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) 
        line termination. Normally on file input newline (line feed) 
        characters are converted to CRLF pairs unless preceded
        by a CR -- this allows reading DOS format files. On output CRLF pairs
        are converted back to new line characters. Set this bit before starting
        to edit a binary file, or when editing a DOS file for which no format
        conversion is desired (ie file is saved back in DOS format).
EZ&8192 This bit is set by default, but has no significance in this release.
EZ&16384 Normally the backup file name is created by replacing the file extension
         with "bak" -- foo.c becomes foo.bak, however if this bit is set then
         the backup file name is created by simply adding ".bak" to the name -- foo.c
         becomes foo.c.bak. This choice is overridden by EZ&1 = 0.
