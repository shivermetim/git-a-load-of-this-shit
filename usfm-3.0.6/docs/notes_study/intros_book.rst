	\ip The opening words of \bk The Gospel according to Mark\bk* tell its readers that the 
	subject of this book is the Good News about Jesus Christ. With the coming of Jesus Christ, 
	it announces, the time set by God to bring salvation to humankind has arrived (1.15). 
	Though the book concentrates on his deeds and words, it is not a biography of Jesus of 
	Nazareth. Only one year, or a little more, of Jesus' life appears to be recorded (chapters 
	1--10), and over one-third of the book (chapters 11--16) is taken up with the last week of 
	Jesus in and near \w Jerusalem\w*. Nothing is said about his birth, childhood, home, or 
	parents. When he first appears, unknown and unannounced, Jesus is a full-grown adult who 
	comes to John the Baptist to be \w baptized\w* by him.
	\ip The author's primary interest in writing is religious. The Gospel is written "from 
	\w faith\w* to faith". ...

	\is1 The Story
	\ip \bk Mark's\bk* story of Jesus is told quickly and with an abundance of details that 
	enhance its dramatic impact. Jesus appears suddenly in Judea, where he joins those who 
	are being baptized in the Jordan by John the Baptist. Just as suddenly, he returns to 
	Galilee, where he proclaims the message that the \w kingdom of god\w* is about to 
	arrive...

	\ip However, he is more than a teacher, healer, or \w miracle\w*-worker. He is also the 
	Messiah, the Son of God, the Son of Man. These three titles express the first Christians' 
	understanding of who Jesus is.
	\ili 1 \k The Messiah\k* is the one promised by God, the one who would come and free God's 
	people. By the time \bk The Gospel of Mark\bk* appeared, the title "Messiah" (in Greek, 
	"\w christ\w*") had become a proper name, so that the Gospel opens with "the Good News 
	about Jesus Christ" (and not "Jesus the Christ"). Peter's confession (8.29) marks a 
	turning-point in the ministry of Jesus. The title "\w son of  david\w* " (10.46-48) also 
	identifies Jesus as the Messiah, who would restore to Israel the power and glory it 
	enjoyed under David's reign (also 12.35-37).
	\ili 2 \k The Son of God\k* is the title by which the heavenly voice addresses Jesus at 
	his baptism (1.11) and his transfiguration (9.7). And at Jesus' death the Roman officer 
	confesses that Jesus is the Son of God (15.39).
	\ili 3 \k The Son of Man\k* is the title most often used of Jesus, and it appears only on 
	the lips of Jesus. This enigmatic title appears in \bk The Book of Daniel\bk* (Dan 7.13n), 
	where it is applied to the exalted figure to whom God gives universal dominion. In 
	\bk Mark\bk* the title is used of Jesus in three ways: the Son of Man acts with divine 
	power (2.10, 28); he will be rejected, will suffer and die (8.31; 9.9, 12, 31; 10.33-34, 
	45; 14.21, 41); he will return in power and glory (8.38; 13.26; 14.62).
